# jQuery Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 16 Hours

This app was designed to take in employee information and store that information in a database.  Each employee will be displayed on a table after being entered, and the user has the option to delete the employee from both the table and database.

The app will add up all employee salaries and calculate the total monthly cost of the companies payroll.  If that amount exceeds $20,000, it will display an alert message and change the background color of the total monthly sum to red.

### Prerequisites

No additional software is needed to run the app.

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
