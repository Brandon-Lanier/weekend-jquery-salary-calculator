# jQuery Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 16 Hours

This app was designed to take in employee information and store that information in a database.  Each employee will be displayed on a table after being entered, and the user has the option to delete the employee from both the table and database.

The app will add up all employee salaries and calculate the total monthly cost of the companies payroll.  If that amount exceeds $20,000, it will display an alert message and change the background color of the total monthly sum to red.
